    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a 15 year old, learning to be a web developer <br>
      with freeCodeCamp, because I would like to have a <br>
      job related to web development/programming. <br>
      I know a bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I'm <br>
      no pro, I've only just started learning JS. <br>
      But I know some Bootstrap, and a tiny bit of jQuery.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mostly have the knowledge to make this page look <br>
      decent, but I'd rather learn more about Bootstrap. <br>
      Because I don't know things like how to make a navbar, <br>
      I just copy-paste the navbar example from Bootstrap's <br>
      page.

      I also use <a href="https://gitter.im" target="_blank">Gitter</a>, you can find me on
      the <a href="https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp" target="_blank">/FreeCodeCamp</a> chat room.

    <h3>Resources I recommend using, for learning web development:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" target="_blank">DevTips</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Personally, I recommend following the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css" target="_blank">'Learn HTML &amp; CSS: Part I'</a> <br>
      course by Codecademy, to get the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. <br>
      Then, I'd say watch some DevTips videos, they can be really helpful <br>
      and fun to watch. Use W3Schools, to look up HTML/CSS tags. Once you <br>
      feel confident with HTML and CSS, I'd recommend using freeCodeCamp. <br>
      I didn't feel like I was going to enjoy it at first, but after <br>
      learning on there, and chatting with the community, I'd have to say <br>
      it's a must for a free learner like me!
